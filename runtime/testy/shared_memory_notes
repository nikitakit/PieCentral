api saves every key seen

when a new key is requested, use current api. returns either None (error) or a (value, value) of (value of key, timestamp)

when studentCode requests value, we first look in studentAPI dictionary to see if we have already requested that value. If so, we check that the timestamp is not stale.
If the timestamp is recent enough, we return the value. 
Otherwise, we treat it as if we have never seen the key before, and request a new one. 

For now, setting values is done the same as before.
